Certainly! Here's a template for a good README.md page for your Iris Flower Classification project on GitHub:

# Iris Flower Classification

This project aims to classify iris flowers into three species: Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolour, and Iris Virginica using machine learning algorithms. The dataset used contains 150 instances, with 50 instances for each class, and includes four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

## Dataset Information

The dataset contains 3 classes of 50 instances each:
- Iris Setosa
- Iris Versicolour
- Iris Virginica

Attribute Information:
- Sepal length in cm
- Sepal width in cm
- Petal length in cm
- Petal width in cm

## Installation

To run the project, you'll need Python 3.x and the following libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

You can install these libraries using pip:

```
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/abhisheklahase29/iris-flower-classification.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd iris-flower-classification
```

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script:

```
jupyter notebook iris_flower_classification.ipynb
```

or

```
python iris_flower_classification.py
```

## Data Visualization

The project includes visualizations of the dataset using various plots such as histograms, boxplots, and scatterplots to understand the distribution and relationships between different features.

## Model Training

Three machine learning algorithms are used for classification:

1. Logistic Regression
2. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
3. Decision Tree Classifier

The dataset is split into training and testing sets, and each algorithm is trained on the training data and evaluated using the testing data.

## Results

The accuracy of each model on the test set is as follows:

- Logistic Regression: 97.77%
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): 97.77%
- Decision Tree Classifier: 95.55%
