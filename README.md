# Projects Repository

This repository contains various projects related to data analysis, machine learning, and other domains. Each project focuses on solving specific problems or exploring interesting datasets.

## Projects Overview

1. **Titanic Survival Prediction**
   - This project aims to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using machine learning techniques. The dataset used for this analysis contains information about passengers such as their age, gender, class, fare, and whether they survived the disaster or not.

2. **Iris Flower Classification**
   - This project aims to classify iris flowers into three species: Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolour, and Iris Virginica using machine learning algorithms. The dataset used contains 150 instances, with 50 instances for each class, and includes four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

3. **Credit Card Fraud Detection**
   - This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. It utilizes a dataset containing credit card transactions, including both legitimate and fraudulent ones, to train a model to classify transactions as either fraudulent or legitimate.
